"""RSA encryption protocol according to PKCS#1 v1.5

See RFC3447__ or the `original RSA Labs specification`__ .

This scheme is more properly called ``RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5``.

**If you are designing a new protocol, consider using the more robust PKCS#1 OAEP.**

As an example, a sender may encrypt a message in this way:

        >>> from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_v1_5
        >>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
        >>> from Crypto.Hash import SHA
        >>>
        >>> message = b'To be encrypted'
        >>> h = SHA.new(message)
        >>>
        >>> key = RSA.importKey(open('pubkey.der').read())
        >>> cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
        >>> ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(message+h.digest())

At the receiver side, decryption can be done using the private part of
the RSA key:

        >>> From Crypto.Hash import SHA
        >>> from Crypto import Random
        >>>
        >>> key = RSA.importKey(open('privkey.der').read())
        >>>
        >>> dsize = SHA.digest_size
        >>> sentinel = Random.new().read(15+dsize)      # Let's assume that average data length is 15
        >>>
        >>> cipher = PKCS1_v1_5.new(key)
        >>> message = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext, sentinel)
        >>>
        >>> digest = SHA.new(message[:-dsize]).digest()
        >>> if digest==message[-dsize:]:                # Note how we DO NOT look for the sentinel
        >>>     print "Encryption was correct."
        >>> else:
        >>>     print "Encryption was not correct."

                The ciphertext that contains the message to recover.
         sentinel : any type
                The object to return to indicate that an error was detected during decryption.

        :Return: A byte string. It is either the original message or the ``sentinel`` (in case of an error).

            If the ciphertext length is incorrect
        :Raise TypeError:
            If the RSA key has no private half.

        :attention:
            You should **never** let the party who submitted the ciphertext know that
            this function returned the ``sentinel`` value.
            Armed with such knowledge (for a fair amount of carefully crafted but invalid ciphertexts),
            an attacker is able to recontruct the plaintext of any other encryption that were carried out
            with the same RSA public key (see `Bleichenbacher's`__ attack).

            In general, it should not be possible for the other party to distinguish
            whether processing at the server side failed because the value returned
            was a ``sentinel`` as opposed to a random, invalid message.

            In fact, the second option is not that unlikely: encryption done according to PKCS#1 v1.5
            embeds no good integrity check. There is roughly one chance
            in 2^16 for a random ciphertext to be returned as a valid message
            (although random looking).

            It is therefore advisabled to:

            1. Select as ``sentinel`` a value that resembles a plausable random, invalid message.
            2. Not report back an error as soon as you detect a ``sentinel`` value.
               Put differently, you should not explicitly check if the returned value is the ``sentinel`` or not.
            3. Cover all possible errors with a single, generic error indicator.
            4. Embed into the definition of ``message`` (at the protocol level) a digest (e.g. ``SHA-1``).
               It is recommended for it to be the rightmost part ``message``.
            5. Where possible, monitor the number of errors due to ciphertexts originating from the same party,
               and slow down the rate of the requests from such party (or even blacklist it altogether).
